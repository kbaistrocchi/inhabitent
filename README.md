I created a custom widget called Category Card so that the end user can edit the text, image and button text of each category card on the front page. This widget required a media uploader and some manipulation of the plugin that we built in class.

Currently, I'm only able to load the widget in a sidebar and not as a block on a page or post. To work around this, I created a new sidebar specifically to display these widgets and load the sidebar on the frontpage.

As an end user, to use the Category Card widget: 
1. Navigate to the widgets area on the Dashboard and drag and drop the Category Card widget into the Front Page Widget Display.
2. Fill in the required fields.
3. View the Front Page to ensure it's working.
